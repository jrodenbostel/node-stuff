Members of Louisville spirit teams will undergo the same drug testing as the rest of the university's athletes.
Spirit squad members will be subject to the same drug testing as the rest of Louisville's athletes, a university official said Thursday, according to the Courier-Journal.

Cheerleader Danielle Cogswell died from an overdose of heroin, amphetamines and Xanax, Jefferson County Coroner Dr. Barbara Weakley-Jones told the newspaper.

"The combination was too much for her," Weakley-Jones said.

Cogswell was found July 28 in an off-campus student housing complex, according to the report.

"We have continued to provide support for our spirit team members as they have worked through their grief," Christine Simatacolos, an associate athletic director for student life at Louisville, said in a statement provided to the paper.
